This program is meant to make it easier for people who have trouble remembering their class schedules.

Upon launching the program the different commands available to the user are given.

Upon exiting the program any object data the user gives about their classes will be saved to a .json file in the same directory as the .py file.

The program will only recognize and load the .json file if it is in the same directory as the .py file so it is reccomended to keep them in their own dedicated folder.
